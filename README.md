# TeamSync - Revolutionizing Team Collaboration

## ðŸš§ Project Status: Under Construction ðŸš§

TeamSync is currently in active development. We're working hard to build a platform that transforms how student teams collaborate on projects.

## Overview

TeamSync addresses the common challenges faced by college students working in teams by providing a simple yet powerful collaboration platform. Unlike complex productivity tools that come with steep learning curves, TeamSync focuses on simplicity and functionality.

## Our Mission

We aim to solve the pain points of teamwork by:

- **Promoting Transparency**: Making individual contributions visible to the entire team
- **Encouraging Accountability**: Tracking work hours and contributions through an engaging leaderboard
- **Maintaining Focus**: Using timed work sessions with random audio alerts to keep team members engaged
- **Facilitating Reflection**: Prompting teams to reflect on their workflow after each session

## Key Features

- **Intuitive Timer**: Track work sessions with minimal setup
- **Engagement Alerts**: Random audio cues keep team members focused
- **Contribution Leaderboard**: Visualize each member's input to the project
- **Reflection Tool**: Improve team dynamics through guided reflection
- **AND MUCH MORE TO COME!**

## Why TeamSync?

TeamSync stands out from other productivity tools because it was designed by students who understand the unique challenges of academic teamwork. We've stripped away unnecessary complexity to focus on what truly matters - getting work done efficiently and fairly as a team.
